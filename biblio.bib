	abstract = {A hybrid control structure that unites bounded control with model predictive control (MPC) is proposed for the constrained stabilization of nonlinear systems. The structure consists of: (1) a ﬁnite-horizon model predictive controller, which can be linear or nonlinear, and with or without stability constraints, (2) a family of bounded nonlinear controllers for which the regions of constrained closed-loop stability are explicitly characterized and (3) a high-level supervisor that orchestrates switching between MPC and the bounded controllers. The central idea is to embed the implementation of MPC within the stability regions of the bounded controllers and employ these controllers as fall-back in the event that MPC is unable to achieve closed-loop stability (due, for example, to infeasibility of a given initial condition and/or horizon length, or due to computational diﬃculties in solving the nonlinear optimization). Switching laws, that monitor the closed-loop state evolution under MPC, are derived to orchestrate the transitions in a way that guarantees asymptotic closed-loop stability for all initial conditions within the union of the stability regions of the bounded controllers. The proposed hybrid control scheme is shown to provide a paradigm for the safe implementation of predictive control algorithms to nonlinear systems, with guaranteed stability regions. The eﬃcacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through applications to chemical reactor and crystallization process examples. Copyright \# 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {"Hybrid systems are those that-unlike classical systems-exhibit both discrete changes, or "jumps", and continuous changes, or "flow." The canonical example of a hybrid system is a bouncing ball: the ball's speed changes continuously between bounces, but there is a discrete jump in velocity each time the ball impacts the ground. Hybrid systems feature widely across disciplines, including in biology, computer science, and mechanical engineering; examples range from fireflies to self-driving cars. Although classical control theory provides powerful tools for analyzing systems that exhibit either flow or jumps, it is ill-equipped to handle hybrid systems, which feature both behaviors. In Hybrid Feedback Control, Ricardo Sanfelice presents a self-contained introduction to the control of hybrid systems, and develops new tools for their design and analysis. This monograph uses hybrid systems notation to present a new, unified control theory framework, thus filling an important gap in the control theory literature. In addition to presenting this theoretical framework, the book also includes a variety of examples and exercises, a Matlab toolbox, and a summary at the beginning of each chapter. The book was originally used in a series of lectures on the topic, and will find a modest amount of crossover course use. The book will also find use outside the field of control, particularly in dynamical systems theory, applied mathematics, and computer science"--},

The key feature of the proposed methodology is the integrated synthesis, via multiple Lyapunov functions, of “lower-level” bounded nonlinear feedback controllers together with “upper-level” switching laws that orchestrate the transitions between the constituent modes and their respective controllers. Both the state and output feedback control problems are addressed. Under the assumption of availability of full state measurements, a family of bounded nonlinear state feedback controllers are initially designed to enforce asymptotic stability for the individual closed-loop modes and provide an explicit characterization of the corresponding stability region for each mode. A set of switching laws are then designed to track the evolution of the state and orchestrate switching between the stability regions of the constituent modes in a way that guarantees asymptotic stability of the overall switched closed-loop system. When complete state measurements are unavailable, a family of output feedback controllers are synthesized, using a combination of bounded state feedback controllers, high-gain observers and appropriate saturation filters to enforce asymptotic stability for the individual closed-loop modes and provide an explicit characterization of the corresponding output feedback stability regions in terms of the input constraints and the observer gain. A different set of switching rules, based on the evolution of the state estimates generated by the observers, is designed to orchestrate stabilizing transitions between the output feedback stability regions of the constituent modes. The differences between the state and output feedback switching strategies, and their implications for the switching logic, are discussed and a chemical process example is used to demonstrate the proposed approach.},

The nonlinear system states are fed to LQR which is designed using a linear state-space model. This is simple as well as robust. The inverted pendulum, a highly nonlinear unstable system, is used as a benchmark for implementing the control methods. Here the control objective is to control the system such that the cart reaches a desired position and the inverted pendulum stabilizes in the upright position. In this paper, the modeling and simulation for optimal control design of nonlinear inverted pendulum-cart dynamic system using PID controller and LQR have been presented for both cases of without and with disturbance input. The Matlab-Simulink models have been developed for simulation and performance analysis of the control schemes. The simulation results justify the comparative advantage of LQR control method.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has had a far reaching impact in robotics. Speciﬁcally, deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been highly effective in synthesizing neural-network controllers for a wide range of tasks. However, despite this empirical success, these controllers still lack theoretical guarantees on their performance, such as Lyapunov stability (i.e., all trajectories of the closed-loop system are guaranteed to converge to a goal state under the control policy). This is in stark contrast to traditional model-based controller design, where principled approaches (like LQR) can synthesize stable controllers with provable guarantees. To address this gap, we propose a generic method to synthesize a Lyapunov-stable neural-network controller, together with a neural-network Lyapunov function to simultaneously certify its stability. Our approach formulates the Lyapunov condition veriﬁcation as a mixed-integer linear program (MIP). Our MIP veriﬁer either certiﬁes the Lyapunov condition, or generates counter examples that can help improve the candidate controller and the Lyapunov function. We also present an optimization program to compute an inner approximation of the region of attraction for the closed-loop system. We apply our approach to robots including an inverted pendulum, a 2D and a 3D quadrotor, and showcase that our neural-network controller outperforms a baseline LQR controller.

We consider the loca1 behavior of control problems described by ( *  = dx/dr) i=f(x,u) ; f(x,0)=0 o and more specifically, the question of determining when there exists a smooth function u(x) such that x = xo is an equilibrium point which is asymPtotically stable. Our main results are formulated in Theorems 1 and 2 be1ow. Whereas it night have been suspected that controllability would insure the exlstence of a stabilizing control law, Theorem I uses a degree-theoretic argument to show this is far from being the case. The positive result of Theorem 2 can be thought of as providing an application of high gain feedback in a nonlinear setting. 1.},

	abstract = {It is well known that controlling the attitude of a rigid body is subject to topological constraints. We illustrate, with examples, the problems that arise when using continuous and (memoryless) discontinuous quaternion-based state-feedback control laws for global attitude stabilization. We propose a quaternion-based hybrid feedback scheme that solves the global attitude tracking problem in three scenarios: full state measurements, only measurements of attitude, and measurements of attitude with angular velocity measurements corrupted by a constant bias. In each case, the hybrid feedback is dynamic and incorporates hysteresis-based switching using a single binary logic variable for each quaternion error state. When only attitude measurements are available or the angular rate is corrupted by a constant bias, the proposed controller is observerbased and incorporates an additional quaternion ﬁlter and bias observer. The hysteresis mechanism enables the proposed scheme to simultaneously avoid the “unwinding phenomenon” and sensitivity to arbitrarily small measurement noise that is present in discontinuous feedbacks. These properties are shown using a general framework for hybrid systems and the results are demonstrated by simulation.},

	abstract = {A hybrid control strategy is introduced that renders a compact set uniformly globally asymptotically stable for a continuous-time plant by switching between a Lyapunovcertified feedback controller and an uncertified controller. This control strategy allows for the opportunistic use of a controller that has desirable performance but lacks a Lyapunov certificate. A pair of tunable threshold functions determine conditions for switching between the controllers. To establish global uniform asymptotic stability, a nonsmooth Lyapunov function is constructed for the closed-loop hybrid system using an auxiliary memory variable and the Lyapunov certificate associated with the certified controller. Examples illustrate improvements to control effort and rate of convergence resulting from the proposed hybrid control strategy when applied to state-feedback and model-predictive control.},

We consider forward (pre-)invariance of sets, which guarantees that the maximal solutions starting from the set stay in it, and (pre-)contractivity, which further requires that the solutions starting from the boundary of the set evolve immediately (continuously or discretely) towards its interior. Our conditions for forward invariance and contractivity are inﬁnitesimal and in terms of the proposed barrier functions. Examples illustrate the results.},
