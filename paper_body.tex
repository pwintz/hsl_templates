\subsection{Hybrid Systems}
% Hybrid System
We consider hybrid systems modeled in the form \cite{goebel_hybrid_2012}
\begin{equation}
    \calH{:}\: \left\{\begin{aligned}
        \dot x \hspace{4pt}&= f(x) & x \in C \\
        x^+ &= g(x) & x \in D
    \end{aligned}\right. 
    \label{eq:hybrid system}
\end{equation}
with state variable $x\in \realsn$, 
flow map $f : C \to \realsn$, 
jump map $g : D \to \realsn$, 
flow set $C \subset \realsn,$ and
jump set $D \subset \realsn$.
See \cref{fig:this is a figure}.
